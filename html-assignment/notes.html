        <h3>Personal develpment</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my years as a mountaineer, my love for the mountains and the environment grew even stronger. I became increasingly aware of the fragility of these natural landscapes and the need for their protection. This led me to pursue studies in various scientific fields related to environmental protection. I started by enrolling in my university's bachelors program in Environmental Science. Here, I delved into subjects such as ecology, conservation biology, and environmental policy. I learned about the interconnectedness of ecosystems, the devastating effects of human activities on the environment, and the importance of sustainable practices. Inspired by this knowledge, I became actively involved in the creation and development of the environmental research program at my university. This program aimed to conduct research on pressing environmental issues and develop innovative solutions to mitigate their impacts. As part of this program, I participated in numerous research projects focused on topics such as climate change, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable resource management. I worked closely with professors and fellow students, conducting fieldwork, collecting data, and analyzing findings. These experiences exposed me to the challenges and complexities of environmental research while providing me with valuable hands-on experience. Through these experiences, I gained a deep understanding of the importance of environmental protection and scientific research's role in addressing environmental challenges. I developed critical thinking skills, honed my ability to analyze complex environmental problems, and learned how to communicate scientific findings to a broader audience. Overall, my studies in environmental science and my active involvement in the creation and development of the environmental research program at my university have shaped me into a passionate advocate for environmental protection. <b>I am committed to utilizing my knowledge and skills to contribute to the preservation of our natural world and to inspire others to do the same.</b>
