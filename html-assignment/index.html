            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am originally from Ecuador, <em>a beautiful paradise in South America.</em> Last year, my wife and I
                made a life-changing decision to
                start fresh. Despite being university teachers, we felt a sense of boredom and something missing in our
                lives. This led us to
                embark on a new journey in a different country. We chose Canada as our destination to pursue our dream
                careers. Personally,
                I decided to follow my long-held interest in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
                On August 17<sup>th</sup>, 2023, we landed in Canada and began our journey from scratch. Every step we
                take in this new life
                has been an adventure, whether it's making small adjustments or tackling significant challenges. Having
                my partner by my side to
                share in the joy, laughter, and occasional tears has made the experience even more fulfilling. We are
                fueled by our determination
                and unwavering work ethic, knowing that we are on the right path to accomplish great things in life.
            </p>
